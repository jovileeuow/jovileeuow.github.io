	<p>A logical design transforms a conceptual schema, into a set of relational schemas. Transformation of a conceptual schema is controlled by a collection of simple rules replacing the components of a simplified class diagram with linear specifications relational schemas, i.e. schema-name( attribute, attribute, ... ) primary key = ... foreign key = ...</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Application of the transformation rules is divided into few steps each one replacing one type of the components of a conceptual schema.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A logical design is performed in the following steps:</p>
	<br/>
	<p>First, the multivalued attributes are replaced with the classes of objects, and depending on the semantics of multivalued attributes, either with one to many, or with many to many associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the second step, the association classes and link attributes, are replaced with the triples that consists of: one to many association, class-of-objects, and many-to-one-association.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the third step, many-to-many associations, are replaced with the triples that consists of: one to many association, class of objects, many to one association.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the fourth step, the qualifications are replaced with one to many associations, and with composite identifiers in object classes on "many" side of one to many associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The remaining steps are listed on the next slide.</p>

	<p>We start from a case 1 where a multivalued attribute is transformed into into a class of objects and many-to-many association. The second case where a multivalued attribute is transformed into a class of objects and one-to-many-association is presented later.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Let us consider a class of objects: BOOK, and a multivalued attribute: author name. An attribute: author name in a class of objects: BOOK, is transformed in the following way.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute: author name is promoted to a new class of objects: AUTHOR. Such transformation is commonly called as a "reification". Next, a single valued attribute: author name, is added as an identifier to a class: AUTHOR.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A multivalued attribute: author name is removed from a class of objects: BOOK. A many to many association: BOOK Is-written-by AUTHOR, is created between the classes of objects: BOOK and AUTHOR.</p>

	<p>An association BOOK Is-written-by AUTHOR is many-to-many because a book can be written by many authors and an author can write many books. Information about multiplicity of an association is obtained from semantics of the association. Note, that multivalued attribute provides only information about of a book having many authors. Information, whether an author can contribute to many books is not included in a multivalued attribute and it must be discovered from semantics of the association and our knowledge of the reality</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The next slide presents a case where a reification provides a new association that is one-to-many.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Elimination of multivalued attributes needs additional information not included in a conceptual schema. It is why we need to look at the semantics/meaning of a multivalued attribute. It is impossible to correctly transform a multivalued attribute without knowing its semantics.</p>

	<p>In the second step, we eliminate association classes and many to many associations through the transformations into one to many and many to one associations. An association class becomes and ordinary class of objects involved in both one-to-many and many-to-one associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example. we consider a many to many association: STUDENTS Enrols SUBJECT, represented by an association class: ENROLMENT. We assume an optimistic case, a student enrols in a subject only one time. the pessimistic case, when a subject is enrolled by the same student many times is considered later.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>First, an association class: ENROLMENT, is transformed in the following way.  Many to many association: STUDENTS Enrols SUBJECT, is removed. A new one-to-many association: STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT, is added between a class of objects: STUDENT, and a class of objects: ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Next, a one-to-many association: SUBJECT is-involved-in ENROLMENT, is added between a class of objects: SUBJECT and a class of objects: ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A qualification with an attribute: subject code (code), is added on a student side of association: STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT and a qualification with an attribute: student number (s#), is added on a subject side of an association: SUBJECT is-involved-in ENROLMENT. The qualifications are need to provide information about a derived identifier of a class ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In a general case, every many-to-many association can be replaced with one-to-many association CLASS OF OBJECTS (that represents an association) and many-to-one association. A derived identifier of CLASS OF OBJECT is a pair of identifiers taken from "one' sides of both associations. In our example it is a pair of attributes (student number, subject code).</p>

	<p>Now, we assume a pessimistic case, where a student must enrol a subject many times. In such a case, an association: STUDENT Enrols SUBJECT, must be qualified in the middle by an attribute: enrolment date (edate). This is, because an identifier of an association class consists of three attributes: students number (s#), subject code(code), and enrolment date (edate).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A many to many association: STUDENT Enrols SUBJECT, and association class: ENROLS, qualified with an attribute: enrolment date (e ate) is transformed in the following way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Many to many association: STUDENT Enrols SUBJECT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A one-to-many association: STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT, is added between a class: STUDENT and a class: ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A one-to-many association: SUBJECT Is-involved-in ENROLMENT, is added between a class: SUBJECT and a class: ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A qualification with the attributes: subject code (code), and enrolment date (e date), is added on STUDENT side of an association: STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A qualification with the attributes: student number (s#), and enrolment date (e date), is added on a SUBJECT side of an association: SUBJECT Is-involved-in ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In a general case any many-to-many association is equivalent to to one-to-many association a class objects representing an association class and many-to-one association on the other side. If many-to-many association is not represented by an association class it is always possible to add an empty association class that has no attributes. Such association class is later on used as a class of objects in-between one-to-many and many-to-one associations , that replace one-to-many association.</p>

	<p>In step four of the logical design, we replace the qualifications.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the present slide, a qualification with an attribute: room number (room#) is eliminated in the following way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The attributes: building number (bldg#), and room number (room#), are copied to a class of objects: ROOM.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A pair of attributes that consists of building number (bldg#), and room number (room#), is tagged with IDn in a class of objects room where "n" depends on the total number of identifiers already determined in a class. Usually "n" is equal to 1 because its is why qualifications has been used: to determine an identifier fro a class that has no identification system.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In this way, a pair (bldg#, room#) becomes an identifier in a class of objects: ROOM.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute: building number (bldg#), is tagged with FKn to denote a foreign key referencing an identifier building number (bldg#) in a class of objects: BUILDING.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A multiplicity of an association: BUILDING Has ROOM, on a ROOM side of qualified association is changed to * or 1..*.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>It is because buildings have zero or more rooms.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>At the end, a qualification with an attribute: room number (room#) is removed.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In a general case a qualification is removed through application of its definition. A qualification provides information'</p>
	<br/>
	<p>about an identifier of a class, that has no own identification system, for example a class ROOM. Hence elimination of qualification must create an identifier for a class that has no own identification system. An identifier is created from the attributes used in qualification and from an identifier of a class located on a qualified side of association.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In our case, it is a class BUILDING with an identifier bldg#. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>An identifier from a class on a qualified side of association (e.g. bldg#) becomes a future foreign key in a relational table ROOM. It is why it is tagged with FKn.</p>

	<p>Continuing an example from the previous slide we find, that a pair of attributes, that consists of: building number (bldg#), and room number (room#), forms an identifier in a class: ROOM.</p>

	<p>A double qualification is transformed in a similar way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example, a double qualification with a pair of attributes: subject code (code), and enrolment date (edate), on one side of association: STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT, with a pair of attributes student number (s#), and enrolment date (edate) on the other side of association: SUBJECT Is-involved-in ENROLMENT is transformed in the following way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A pair of attributes, that consists of: subject code (code), and enrolment date (edate) and a pair of  attributes that consists of: student number (s#), and enrolment date  (edate) are copied to a class of objects: ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>It is the same transformation as before. The attributes used in qualification and an identifier of a class on a qualified side of association are copied on the other side of association,</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Then, a triple of attributes, that consists of: subject code (code), student number (s#), and enrolment date (edate) is tagged with IDn in a class of objects: ENROLMENT. It means that such triple becomes and identifier in a class ENROLMENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute: subject code (code), is tagged with FKn to denote a foreign key referencing an identifier: subject code (code), in a class of objects: SUBJECT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute: student number (s#) is tagged with FKm, where m is not necessarily equal to n, to denote a foreign key referencing an identifier: student number (s#), in a class of objects: STUDENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Both 0..1 multiplicities on the left and right side of a class of objects: ENROLMENT, are changed to * or to 1..* depending on whether the associations SUBJECT Is-involved-in ENROLMENT and STUDENT Performs ENROLMENT are mandatory or optional on ENROLMENT side. To decide what multiplicities should be sued we have to ask the question: "is it possible, that a student has no enrolments ?" and "is it possible, that a subject has no enrolments ?".  If the answers to both questions are positive than we use an optional multiplicity * or 0..*.</p>

	<p>In the sixth step of logical design, one to one associations are transformed in the following way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The object classes from both sides of one to one association are merged into a single class of objects.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example a triple, that consists of the objects classes: CHAIRMAN, and SCHOOL, and an association: CHAIRMAN Is-head-of SCHOOL, is merged into one class of objects: SCHOOL. The attributes: employee number (emp#), first name, last name, and date of birth (dob), that come from an optional 0..1 side of the association: CHAIRMAN Is-head-of SCHOOL, are tagged with 0..1 tag as optional attributes.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute like: name of school (name), that was an identifier of a class of objects on mandatory side, 1..1, of the association obtains a tag IDn.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A tag IDn means, that it is an identifier of a new class obtained from the merge of the classes CHAIRMAN and SCHOOL. It means that every instance of an object of the new class must have a value of an attribute school name (name). Later on IDn will be converted into PK, i.e. a primary key of a relational table implementing the new class of objects</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute like: employee number (emp#), that was an identifier of a class of objects on an optional side of association obtains a tag CKn. It is because it may happen that a school does not have a chairman due to an optional side of association on CHAIRMAN class side. Then a tag IDn is not appropriate because a value of an attribute employee number (emp#) maybe missing. In such a case and attribute employee number (emp#) can be at most a candidate key and not primary key.</p>

	<p>In the seventh step of logical design, the generalisation hierarchies are transformed with the superset, subset and association methods.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>We start from a superset method.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A superset method transforms entire generalisation hierarchy into a single class of objects by moving all attributes to the immediate higher level class of objects, changing multiplicities of attributes, and adding categorisation attributes.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>All attributes from the classes of objects at the lower levels of generalisation hierarchy are copied to the topmost level in the hierarchy and then such attributes become the optional attributes marked with 0..1 tag there.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example, the attributes: project and thesis, are copied from the classes of objects: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT and POSTGRADUATE STUDENT, to a class of objects: STUDENT.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A categorisation attribute, that determines a subtype of a superclass is added to a superclass.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example, an attribute: type of student, is added to a class of objects: STUDENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Such attribute is necessary to distinguish between postgraduate and undergraduate students.</p>

	<p>After the attributes from lower levels of generalisation are moved to their parent class all classes below the parent class are removed from a conceptual schema.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The process is repeated until only the topmost class is left. It is important to remember that each time a set of attributes from subclasses is moved to a superclass we must remember about categorisation attribute. If a generalisation hierarchy has several levels then categorisation attributes from the lower levels must be moved to the higher levels. For example, of a class UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT has subclasses IT STUDENT and CS STUDENT then first elimination of the lowest level in the hierarchy contributes to a categorisation attribute it-or-cs. Then, elimination of the subclasses at the higher level contributes to a categorisation attribute pg-or-ug. Please remember that an attribute it-or-cs must be moved to the topmost class STUDENT as an optional attribute. i.e. it must be tagged with [0..1]. It is because we do not distinguish between it and cs students at postgraduate level.</p>

	<p>Next, to eliminate a generalisation hierarchy, we look at a subset method.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A subset method transforms the entire generalisation hierarchy, into several classes of objects in the following way. All attributes from the classes of objects at the higher levels of generalisation hierarchy, are copied to the classes of objects at the lowest levels of generalisation hierarchy.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example, the attributes student number (s#), first name, last name and date of birth (dob) are copied from a class of objects: STUDENT, to the classes of objects: POSTGRADUATE STUDENT, and UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Copying the attributes from a superclasses to subclasses is nothing else as application of inheritance. If a postgraduate student is a student then all attributes and associations of a student are inherited by a postgraduate students accordingly to a rule postgraduate student ISA student.</p>

	<p>Finally, to eliminate a generalisation hierarchy, we look at an association method.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An association method transforms the entire generalisation hierarchy, into several of classes of objects in the following way. One of the identifiers from a superclass of objects is copied to all subclasses of objects located one level below in a hierarchy.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>For example, an identifier: student number (s#) is copied from a class of objects: STUDENT, to the classes of objects: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, and POSTGRADUATE STUDENT. An identifier that has been copied obtains a tag FKn in the subclasses.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The same procedure is repeated for all subclasses of objects at the same level in a generalisation hierarchy.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>After application of association method the classes STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, and POSTGRADUATE STUDENT change their semantics/meaning. A class STUDENT contains the objects that are the common descriptions of postgraduate and undergraduate students. A class UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT contains the objects that are the descriptions of undergraduate students only. A class POSTGRADUATE STUDENT contains the objects that are the descriptions of postgraduate students only.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A meaning of an association is Consists_of. For example STUDENT Consists-of UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT description or STUDENT Consists-of POSTGRADUATE STUDENT description.</p>

	<p>A conceptual schema given in the present slide represents a simple database domain, that contains information about: parts, customers, orders submitted by customers, contents of each order, suppliers and parts shipped by suppliers.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>We plan to apply the transformations of the logical design to convert a conceptual schema into a collection of relational schemas.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>We start from the transformations of multivalued attributes. There is only one multivalued attribute: phone number (phone#), in a class of objects: SUPPLIER.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule for multivalued attributes says: create a new class of objects that represents the values of a multivalued attribute, add a single valued attribute to describe a new class and create either one-to-many or many-to-many-association between a new class and a class earlier desccribed by a multivalued attribute.</p>

	<p>The following conceptual schema, is obtained after the transformations of multivalued attributes.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A new class of objects: phone, has been created.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The class of objects is described by an attribute: number, and the attribute is an identifier of the class, see ID1 tag.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An association SUPPLIER Has PHONE has been added to the design. The new association is on-to-many because a supplier may have many phones and a phone has only one owner.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the next step, we transform the association classes and link attributes.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>There is one association class: PART-SHIPPED-BY and there are no link attributes.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule for association classes says: replace many-to-many association represented by an association class with the following structure: one-to-many association connected on many side to a class of object the same as an association class and many-to-one association connected on many side to a class of objects the same as an association class. Then use qualifications to determine an identifier of a new class in between one-to-many and many-to-one associations.</p>

	<p>The following conceptual schema, is obtained after transformation of association classes.</p>

	<p>Transformation of an association class: PART-SHIPPED-BY,  created a new class of objects: PART-SHIPPED-BY and one-to-many association PART Shipped-in PART-SHIPPED-BY, and one-to-many association SUPPLIER Involved-in PART-SHIPPED-BY.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The qualifications determine an identifier of a class of objects: PART-SHIPPED-BY. A qualification of an association PART Shipped-in PART-SHIPPED-BY with the attributes shipment-date and sname on PART side of association means, that an identifier of a class PART-SHIPPED-BY consists of the attributes (p#, shipment-date, sname).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A qualification of an association SUPPLIER Involved-in PART-SHIPPED-BY with the attributes shipment-date and p# on SUPPLIER side of association means, that an identifier of a class PART-SHIPPED-BY consists of the attributes (p#, shipment-date, sname).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Next, we transform many to many associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule for many-to-many associations says: create a new association class that represents many-to-many association and later on eliminate a new associations class. It means, that the transformation is  almost the same as a transformation of association classes,</p>

	<p>The design does not have any many-to-many associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Next, we transform the qualifications.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>There are three qualifications. An association: ORDER Consists-of LINEITEM, is qualified with an attribute: line number (line#) on a side of ORDER class of objects to provide information about an identifier in a class of objects: LINEITEM.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An association: PART Shipped-in PART-SHIPPED-BY, is qualified with the attributes: shipment-date and supplier name (sname) to provide information about an identifier of a class of objects: PART-SHIPPED-BY.

	<br/>
	<p>An association: SUPPLIER Involved-in PART-SHIPPED-BY, is qualified with the attributes: shipment-date and part number (p#) to provide information about an identifier of a class of objects: PART-SHIPPED-BY.
</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule for qualifications says: copy the attributes used in a qualification and one of the identifiers of a class on a qualified side of association to a class on an unqualified side of association. Append ID tag to all attributes copied, i.e. create a composite identifier, that consists of the attributes used in qualification and identifier borrowed from a class on a qualified side of association. Append a tag FKn to an attributed borrowed from a class on a qualified side of association. FKn  means, that later on, it is going to be a foreign key referencing a primary key.</p>

	<br/>
	<p>Elimination of qualifications adds the attributes: order number (order#), and line number (line#), to a class of objects: LINEITEM. A pair of attributes: order number (order#), and line number (line#), becomes an identifier in a class of objects: LINEITEM.

	<p>An attribute: order number (order#), becomes a foreign key referencing the future primary key in the future relational schema: ORDER.

	<p>A conceptual schema given in the present slide is created  after migration of the foreign keys.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>An attribute: phone number (phone), has been copied from a class of objects: CUSTOMER, to a class of objects: ORDER, and it has been tagged with FK1 to denote the future foreign key referencing a primary key in the future relational schema: CUSTOMER.</p>

	<p>In the next step we transform one-to-one associations.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule fro one-to-one associations says: the classes of objects involved in one-to-one association are merged into a single class. One of identifier from a class of object on mandatory side of one-to-one association obtains a tag IDn. The attributes describing a class on optional sode of one-to-one association obtain a tag [0..1].</p>

	<p>The conceptual schema does not have any one to one associations, and because of that transformations of one to one associations can be skipped.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Next, we transform the generalisation hierarchies. The conceptual schema has one generalisation hierarchy: FREQUENT-CUSTOMER ISA CUSTOMER.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In this case we use association method to transform a generalisation hierarchy. It is recommended to practice yourself the other two methods: subset and superset.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>A transformation rule for association method says: copy an identifier from a superclass to subclasses and replace generalization with one-to-one associations between a superclass and subclasses. Append a tag FKn REFERENCES SUPER-CLASS to identifier copied to subclasses.</p>

	<p>A transformation of generalisation hierarchy: FREQUENT CUSTOMER ISA CUSTOMER with an association method is performed in the following way.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>We copy an identifier: phone number (phone) from a class of objects: CUSTOMER, to a class of objects: FREQUENT CUSTOMER.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Then, we tag with FK1 an attribute phone number (phone) in a class of objects: FREQUENT CUSTOMER,  and we add a clause: REFERENCES CUSTOMER(PHONE) to denote the future foreign key referencing a primary key in the future relational schema: CUSTOMER.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Next, we remove a generalisation hierarchy.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>In the next step of logical design, we create the primary keys and candidate keys.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The transformation rule for creating primary candidate keys says: All attributes tagged with the IDn tag from either primary key or candidate key. If one of such attributes is option then may contribute to a candidate key only. The attributes forming a primary kay are tagged with PK. The attributes forming candidate keys are tagged with CKn. A value of n depends on how many candidate keys can be created.</p>
